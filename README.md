This project provides a website for young entrepreneurs to put their demo projects or startup ideas on to get networking and funding opportunities as well as community guidance and support, its a platform for innovation, ideas, development and progressing.
The idea is to create an online version of sharktank so as to avail easy funding opportunities, easily spotlight and showcase shining ideas giving them a chance so that they don't get overlooked, reduce communication gap between potential startup ideas, investors and people, making it easy and accessible as they wouldn't have a hard time approaching each other and shaping innovation into reality as well as supporting entrepreneurship amongst young minds.
It has features like an upvote system and a rotating section for top projects of the week for the top project placeholders of that particular week, FAQs. login/signup page, contact us, feed, home page, notifications, my profile and so much more.
We plan on including private messaging to maintain easy contact with others as well as scaling it to a global level.

We hope you like our project!
